As an indicator of climate change, the surface water temperature of plateau lakes is particularly sensitive to climate warming. In this study, the machine learning model and physical process model are combined to predict water temperature in lake systems: The Air2water model and the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model are combined to form a prediction model for the inversion and prediction of 11 typical plateau lakes in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The modeling results show that the Air2water model performs best, followed by the LSTM model. Overall, the Air2water model and the LSTM model effectively reproduce the monthly, seasonal, and interannual variations of LSWT dynamics in the 11 lakes. The research results show that the LSWT data set from 2021 to 2025 is constructed based on the forecast result, and it is found that six lakes, including Caohai, Dianchi, Erhai, Qionghai, Xingyun Lake and Yangzonghai, showed significant warming in the next five years (the maximum warming rate was less than +0.2 ∘ C/year), while the remaining five lakes showed no significant changes, and the size classification of LSWT data in different spaces on the interannual scale was consistent with the classification of altitudes. By conducting extensive exploration and research on the inversion of LSWT using physical process models and machine learning models, this study offers novel solutions for LSWT prediction and inversion. The study also provides a solid theoretical and practical foundation for future LSWT research, thereby holding practical significance and research value.\nDownload paper here\n","date":1701216000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1701216000,"objectID":"8be78710784d209b84853dbeabff0591","permalink":"https://Xu-shan-shan.github.io/zh/publication/journal-article/2023/jstars-xu/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/journal-article/2023/jstars-xu/","section":"publication","summary":"Lakes, Predictive models, Biological system modeling, Temperature sensors, Water monitoring, Land surface temperature.","tags":["LSTM","LSWT","Air2water model","remote sensing"],"title":"Prediction of surface water temperature and its spatial-temporal variation characteristics of 11 main lakes in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau","type":"publication"},{"authors":["许姗姗","Kun Yang","Xiaolu Zhou","Jie Zhang","Chenghao Yang","Yi Luo"],"categories":["LSTM","LSWT","Air2water model","remote sensing"],"content":"[29/11/23] 我们的论文 Prediction of surface water temperature and its spatial-temporal variation characteristics of 11 main lakes in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau 已经被 the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (JCR Q1 IF=4.7) 录用， 祝贺！！\n","date":1699833600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1700697600,"objectID":"a53d0db11a1ddfddc2a0a6bd25ec4c30","permalink":"https://Xu-shan-shan.github.io/zh/news/2023/1129/","publishdate":"2023-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/news/2023/1129/","section":"news","summary":"1篇JCR 1区论文录用","tags":["论文","录用"],"title":"Nov. 2023: 祝贺！！我们的1篇论文被JSTARS（JCR Q1) 录用！","type":"news"},{"authors":["许姗姗"],"categories":null,"content":"[01/09/23] 许姗姗受邀成为 中铁建设集团中原建设有限公司的外聘专家，任期1年，负责提供理论与技术指导\n祝贺!\n","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1719705600,"objectID":"ba40f0afb116889b3d1fa4ca2b866123","permalink":"https://Xu-shan-shan.github.io/zh/news/2023/0901/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/news/2023/0901/","section":"news","summary":"被 中铁建设集团中原建设有限公司 聘用为 外聘专家，为期1年","tags":["Job"],"title":"Sept. 2023: 许姗姗受邀成为外聘专家","type":"news"},{"authors":["张杰","许姗姗","袁凌云"],"categories":["区块链","物联网","访问控制"],"content":"我们在2022年录用的论文在23年5月即被入选为CNKI高被引和高下载论文，祝贺！！ ","date":1691107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1691107200,"objectID":"29f84e64e5d7e8ec9e02a5e98791c007","permalink":"https://Xu-shan-shan.github.io/zh/news/2023/0817/","publishdate":"2023-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/news/2023/0817/","section":"news","summary":"论文入选CNKI高被引与高下载论文","tags":["论文","证书","区块链","物联网","访问控制"],"title":"Aug. 2023: 祝贺！！我们的1篇论文入选CNKI高被引和高下载！","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science, Ministry of Education, East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200241, China School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200241, China Key Laboratory of Spatial-temporal Big Data Analysis and Application of Natural Resources in Megacities, Ministry of Natural Resources, Shanghai, 200241, China ","date":1687824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1687824000,"objectID":"de2c54a841cdd1aa3c6e7ed560e972fa","permalink":"https://Xu-shan-shan.github.io/zh/project/theoretical-research-copy/","publishdate":"2023-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/project/theoretical-research-copy/","section":"project","summary":"No. 13901-412312-23183","tags":["Foundation"],"title":"Research on train vibration frequency and propagation characteristics of roadbed and soil","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science, Ministry of Education, East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200241, China School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200241, China Key Laboratory of Spatial-temporal Big Data Analysis and Application of Natural Resources in Megacities, Ministry of Natural Resources, Shanghai, 200241, China ","date":1682553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1682553600,"objectID":"1062b8af8d74ddbf4cf285056f04267f","permalink":"https://Xu-shan-shan.github.io/zh/project/theoretical-research/","publishdate":"2023-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/project/theoretical-research/","section":"project","summary":"No. 13901-412312-22250","tags":["Theoretical Research","Foundation"],"title":"Theoretical Research of Launching and Receiving Hood System for Short Sleeve Without Reinforcement in Shield and Pipe Jacking","type":"project"},{"authors":["许姗姗"],"categories":["Python","Tutorials"],"content":"Causes Because the .nc original image to tiff format is also processed by the code, there is some error in the data inside after cropping.

Facing Edge-Iot, which is a heterogeneous network composed of most resource-limited IoT devices and some nodes with higher computing power. For the problems of high resource consumption and difficult deployment of existing blockchain platforms, we design a lightweight blockchain (LBC) with improvement of the proof-of-work consensus. For the access control policies, the threshold tree and LSSS are used for conversion and assignment, stored in the blockchain to protect the privacy of the policy. For device and data, six smart contracts are designed to realize the ABAC and penalty mechanism, with which ABE is outsourced to edge nodes for privacy and integrity. Thus, our scheme realizing Edge-Iot privacy protection, data and device controlled access. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure and the experimental results show that our LBC has higher throughput and lower resources consumption, the cost of encryption and decryption of our scheme is desirable.\nThis paper is about data security in Edge-Iot. To accomplish lightweight encryption outsourcing in an edge-device architecture, improved CP-ABE algorithm.

Urbanization has changed the structure of the natural land surface and led to the intensification of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This will affect the surface runoff temperature, which, in turn, will affect the surface water temperature of urban lakes. This study will use UAS TIR (un-manned aerial system thermal infrared radiance) remote sensing and in situ observation technology to monitor the urban space surface temperature and thermal runoff in Kunming, Yunnan, in summer; explore the feasibility of UAS TIR remote sensing to continuously observe urban surface temperature during day and night; and analyze thermal runoff pollution. The results of the study show that the difference between UAS TIR LSTs and in situ LSTs (in situ air temperature 10 cm above the ground.) varies with the type of land covers. Urban surface thermal runoff has varying degrees of impact on water bodies. Based on the influence of physical factors such as vegetation and buildings and meteorological factors such as solar radiation, the RMSE between UAS LSTs and in situ LSTs varies from 1 to 5 °C. Land cover types such as pervious bricks, asphalt, and cement usually show higher RMSE values. Before and after rainfall, the in situ data of the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) showed a phenomenon of first falling and then rising. The linear regression analysis results show that the R2 of the daytime model is 0.92, which has high consistency; the average R2 at night is 0.38; the averages R2 before and after rainfall are 0.50 and 0.83, respectively; and the average RMSE is 1.94 °C. Observational data shows that thermal runoff quickly reaches thermal equilibrium with the land surface temperature about 30 min after rainfall. The thermal runoff around the lake has a certain warming effect on LSWT.\nDownload paper here\n","date":1626134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1626134400,"objectID":"2912a851545a924e5c0f739cc58dbb46","permalink":"https://Xu-shan-shan.github.io/zh/publication/journal-article/2021/suutainability-xu/","publishdate":"2021-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/journal-article/2021/suutainability-xu/","section":"publication","summary":"urban heat island; UAS TIR; remote sensing; land covers; thermal runoff; LSWT.","tags":["LSTM","Urban","UAS","remote sensing"],"title":"Urban Land Surface Temperature Monitoring and Surface Thermal Runoff Pollution Evaluation Using UAV Thermal Remote Sensing Technology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["许姗姗","Yi Luo","Kun Yang","Ruimei Liu"],"categories":["Atmosphere-Water","System"],"content":"abstract: With the rapid economic development and the acceleration of urbanization, increase the Concentration of PM2.5, leading to a continuous decline in China’s air quality.
