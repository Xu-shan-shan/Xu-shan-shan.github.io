      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;In the context of global warming, the Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) exhibits a general upward trend. As an indicator of climate change, the surface water temperature of plateau lakes is particularly sensitive to climate warming. In this study, the machine learning model and physical process model are combined to predict water temperature in lake systems: The Air2water model and the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model are combined to form a prediction model for the inversion and prediction of 11 typical plateau lakes in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The modeling results show that the Air2water model performs best, followed by the LSTM model. Overall, the Air2water model and the LSTM model effectively reproduce the monthly, seasonal, and interannual variations of LSWT dynamics in the 11 lakes. The research results show that the LSWT data set from 2021 to 2025 is constructed based on the forecast result, and it is found that six lakes, including Caohai, Dianchi, Erhai, Qionghai, Xingyun Lake and Yangzonghai, showed significant warming in the next five years (the maximum warming rate was less than +0.2 ∘ C/year), while the remaining five lakes showed no significant changes, and the size classification of LSWT data in different spaces on the interannual scale was consistent with the classification of altitudes. By conducting extensive exploration and research on the inversion of LSWT using physical process models and machine learning models, this study offers novel solutions for LSWT prediction and inversion. The study also provides a solid theoretical and practical foundation for future LSWT research, thereby holding practical significance and research value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;In view of the security issues of the Internet of Things (IoT), considered better combining edge computing and blockchain with the IoT, integrating attribute-based encryption (ABE) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) models with attributes as the entry point, an attribute-based encryption and access control scheme (ABE-ACS) has been proposed. Facing Edge-Iot, which is a heterogeneous network composed of most resource-limited IoT devices and some nodes with higher computing power. For the problems of high resource consumption and difficult deployment of existing blockchain platforms, we design a lightweight blockchain (LBC) with improvement of the proof-of-work consensus. For the access control policies, the threshold tree and LSSS are used for conversion and assignment, stored in the blockchain to protect the privacy of the policy. For device and data, six smart contracts are designed to realize the ABAC and penalty mechanism, with which ABE is outsourced to edge nodes for privacy and integrity. Thus, our scheme realizing Edge-Iot privacy protection, data and device controlled access. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure and the experimental results show that our LBC has higher throughput and lower resources consumption, the cost of encryption and decryption of our scheme is desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;This paper is about data security in Edge-Iot. To accomplish lightweight encryption outsourcing in an edge-device architecture, improved CP-ABE algorithm. Then to achieve the secure access to IoT data, attempt have been made to implement an attribute-based access control model. Try to build a blockchain network on a restricted terminal, built a lightweight blockchain LBC to adapt to IoT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a specific comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison of theoretical overhead with other papers on CP-ABE’s outsourced computation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparing the cost of lightweight blockchain LBC with private Fabric and Ethereum;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the implementation algorithm of access control related contracts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not Submit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest problem is that the scene is not clear, the research value is not sufficient;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the security proof is weak, the research content is not specific enough;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The security strength between access control and ciphertext is repeated&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;With the continuous advancement of urbanization, the impervious surface expands. Urbanization has changed the structure of the natural land surface and led to the intensification of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This will affect the surface runoff temperature, which, in turn, will affect the surface water temperature of urban lakes. This study will use UAS TIR (un-manned aerial system thermal infrared radiance) remote sensing and in situ observation technology to monitor the urban space surface temperature and thermal runoff in Kunming, Yunnan, in summer; explore the feasibility of UAS TIR remote sensing to continuously observe urban surface temperature during day and night; and analyze thermal runoff pollution. The results of the study show that the difference between UAS TIR LSTs and in situ LSTs (in situ air temperature 10 cm above the ground.) varies with the type of land covers. Urban surface thermal runoff has varying degrees of impact on water bodies. Based on the influence of physical factors such as vegetation and buildings and meteorological factors such as solar radiation, the RMSE between UAS LSTs and in situ LSTs varies from 1 to 5 °C. Land cover types such as pervious bricks, asphalt, and cement usually show higher RMSE values. Before and after rainfall, the in situ data of the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) showed a phenomenon of first falling and then rising. The linear regression analysis results show that the R2 of the daytime model is 0.92, which has high consistency; the average R2 at night is 0.38; the averages R2 before and after rainfall are 0.50 and 0.83, respectively; and the average RMSE is 1.94 °C. Observational data shows that thermal runoff quickly reaches thermal equilibrium with the land surface temperature about 30 min after rainfall. The thermal runoff around the lake has a certain warming effect on LSWT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;With the rapid economic development and the acceleration of urbanization, increase the Concentration of PM2.5, leading to a continuous decline in China&amp;rsquo;s air quality. PM2.5 will cause a series of social problems such as damage to human health, reduced visibility, environmental pollution, and hidden traffic hazards. Many researchers are committed to PM2.5 pollution research, effective and reliable PM2.5 historical data is the basis of these studies. This research will design and develop a data query Visualization platform that provides national monthly, quarterly, and annual average PM2.5 Concentrations. The platform can provide researchers with effective, reliable, and processed data for free, which will greatly reduce the time cost of data processing in the early stage of the experiment and shorten the research cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Internet of things access control model based on blockchain and edge computing</title>
      <link>https://Xu-shan-shan.github.io/en/publication/journal-article/2022/joca-zhang/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;The emergence of edge computing has expanded the scope of Internet of Things （IoT） cloud-terminal architecture. With the reduction of transmission and processing delays of massive data on terminal devices， it also brings new security issues. Aiming at the problem of data security and management issues between edge nodes of IoT and massive heterogeneous devices， and considering that blockchain technology is widely used in the security management of data in distributed systems， an IoT access control model Smart Contract for Attribute-Based Access Control （SC-ABAC） was proposed based on blockchain and edge computing. Firstly， an IoT access control architecture integrated with edge computing was proposed， and by combining smart contracts with Attribute-Based Access Control （ABAC）， SC-ABAC was proposed and designed. Then， the optimization of Proof of Work （PoW） consensus algorithm and the access control management flow of SC-ABAC were given. Experimental results show that the time consumed by the proposed model increases linearly with the number of times under continuous access to the block， the Central Processing Unit （CPU） utilization rate is stable， and the CPU security is good during the continuous access process. In this model， the time consumption of calling contracts in the query process only increases linearly with the times， and the time consumptions of the strategy addition and judgment process are both constant. And the optimized consensus mechanism has about 18.37 percentage points less time consumption than PoW consensus per 100 blocks. Therefore， the proposed model can provide decentralized， fine-grained and dynamic access control management in the IoT environment， and can reach consensus faster in a distributed system to ensure data consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;This paper is about IoT security. In the cloud-edge-end architecture, try to implement access control based on blockchain and give a SC-ABAC model and a simple prototype. SC-ABAC is Smart Contract for Attribute-Based Access Control, and the POW consensus algorithm has been improved in the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
